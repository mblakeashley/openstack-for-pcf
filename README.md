**Run on Contoller or Compute** -
`remove_openstack.sh` is used to remove OpenStack installations. This will remove Packstack and all related OpenStack services, does not remove the OpenStack Repo.


## Deploy OpenStack

We are using `packstack` to deploy our OpenStack environment, `gss_stack_env28.conf` is used as a pre-populated template when running the packstack command to deploy.

command usage:
`packstack --answer-file=gss_stack_env28.conf`

The deployment will take 15-20 minutes to complete, depending on current network speeds.


completed output...
