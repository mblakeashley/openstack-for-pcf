# openstack-for-pcf
This Project is meant to automate dependencies for deploying OpenStack + PCF

## Openstack Installation Prerequisites

All must be met, otherwise scripts or OpenStack deployment will fail.
* These setting are automated via `govmomi` Go library for interacting with VMware vSphere APIs

```
## Create Base VM's for OpenStack IaaS
govc vm.create -on=false -pool=RP28 -ds=/Datacenter/datastore/LUN01 -c=16 -m=90000 -disk=700GB -net.address=00:50:56:ac:e5:83 -net=env28 gss-lab-28-controller
govc vm.create -on=false -pool=RP28 -ds=/Datacenter/datastore/LUN01 -c=16 -m=90000 -disk=700GB -net.address=00:50:56:ac:e5:14 -net=env28 gss-lab-28-compute
```

* CentOS 7 minimal installed to latest release update.
* Kernel version (â‰¥) 4.0
* 2 VM's 
  * **Controller** - **(2)** NIC's on lab-subnet, **(16)** vCPU with nested enabled via vSphere Web UI, **(90)** GB of RAM and **(700)** GB HDD 
  * **Compute** - **(1)** NIC on lab-subnet, **(16)** vCPU with nested enabled via vSphere Web UI, **(90)** GB of RAM and **(700)** GB HDD
  * If `nested` option is not enabled for these VM's the OpenStack installation will fail.

## Openstack Tuning for PCF
* Default vaule of `CONFIG_CINDER_VOLUMES_SIZE` may vary for various instsallation methods, However, this setting will notabley kill a PCF deployment early on if value is not large enough. This volume group needs to be set large enough to fill a standard PCF in regards to initial disk space.

* When creating Project/Tenant's in OpenStack, keep in mind of what values are selected to its quota. Most default values of note - `Floating IP addresses`, `Cinder Volumes`, `vCPU` and `RAM`, all of which can cause PCF deployments to fail, if set too low.

* Much like AWS, `.pem` keys are vital to successful to OpenStack and PCF deployments. Sometimes OpenStack can be buggie with key's, with best option to gereate keys on OpenStack as opposed uploading pre-generated keys.

* Security groups are vital, such as ports enabled during PCF deployments, these groups are managed via Project/Tenant.

## Scripts

** Deployment Details**
We use a mix of bash and ansible to deploy our OpenStack IaaS via ConcouseCI Pipelines.

**Runs on Compute & Contoller** -
`deploy_packstack_packages.sh` is inteded to install all package and yum repo's for Packstack - OpenStack deployments

script output..
```
[root@contoller openstack-for-pcf]# ./deploy_packstack_packages.sh
+ Running YUM Update                                       [  OK  ]
+ Installing Base Packages                                 [  OK  ]
+ Installing GNOME Desktop.. This will take some time      [  OK  ]
+ Adding OpenStack Repo - Mitaka                           [  OK  ]
+ Installing Packstack                                     [  OK  ]
```

**Runs on Compute & Contoller** -
`deploy_packstack_provisioning.sh` is inteded to provision the Controller VM base OS to support OpenStack + PCF Deployments

script output...
```
[root@contoller openstack-for-pcf]# ./deploy_packstack_provisioning.sh 
+ Checking user accounts                                   [  OK  ]

                                                           [  OK  ]

+ Ping Compute                                             [  OK  ]
```

**Run on Contoller or Compute** -
`remove_openstack.sh` is used to remove OpenStack installations. This will remove Packstack and all related OpenStack services, does not remove the OpenStack Repo.


## Deploy OpenStack

We are using `packstack` to deploy our OpenStack environment, `gss_stack_env28.conf` is used as a pre-populated template when running the packstack command to deploy.

command usage:
`packstack --answer-file=gss_stack_env28.conf`

The deployment will take 15-20 minutes to complete, depending on current network speeds.


completed output...
```
 **** Installation completed successfully ******


Additional information:
 * Time synchronization installation was skipped. Please note that unsynchronized time on server instances might be problem for some OpenStack components.
 * File /root/keystonerc_admin has been created on OpenStack client host 10.193.93.2. To use the command line tools you need to source the file.
 * To access the OpenStack Dashboard browse to http://10.193.93.2/dashboard .
Please, find your login credentials stored in the keystonerc_admin in your home directory.
 * To use Nagios, browse to http://10.193.93.2/nagios username: nagiosadmin, password: `redacted`
 * Because of the kernel update the host 10.193.93.3 requires reboot.
 * Because of the kernel update the host 10.193.93.2 requires reboot.
 * The installation log file is available at: /var/tmp/packstack/20170321-135711-NtV9ny/openstack-setup.log
